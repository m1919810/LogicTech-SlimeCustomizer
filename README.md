# About this slimeCustomizer
## The Aim
- LogicTech is a slimeCustomizer depend mainly on FinalTECH
- As we all know ,FinalTECH's powerful machines like STORAGE_AND_TRANSFER and ITEM_DISMANTLE_TABLE often make server sft worse
- So we aimed to reduce machine number and server lag by increasing the complexity of crafting-recipe and crafting-process
- And make compressed machines with high productivity to provide players better gaming experience
- Also ,we aimed to reduce the CRAFTER player used,by transfering crafting-path
## How
- LogicTech aims to abstract the logic of the complex producing line and reflect it in the complexity of the crafting recipes.
- By creating YITIJI(all_in_one_machine) and COMPRESSED_MACHINE(many_in_one)
## About FinalTech
- LogicTech is based mainly on FinalTech v2 -preview
- I know that some items and machines are overpowered in FinalTECH, like MATRIX_REACTOR and PHONY
- This slimecustomizer CAN work if MATRIX_REACTOR are banned
- And it will probably reduce the number of FINALTECH_TRANSFER, DISMANTLE_TABLE, NTW_CRAFTER and other FinalTECH machines placed in world
